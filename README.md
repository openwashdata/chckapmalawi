### Visualizing Vegetable Distribution in Malawi Gardens

This code snippet utilizes rAmCharts4 in R to visualize vegetable
diversity in Malawian gardens. By displaying the distribution of crops
grown, it highlights how Malawians can self-provide a diverse range of
vegetables, crucial for a balanced diet.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(rAmCharts4)
#> Warning: Paket 'rAmCharts4' wurde unter R Version 4.3.2 erstellt

chckapmalawi$vegetables_grown_in_garden <- gsub("Other \\(please specify\\)", "Other", chckapmalawi$vegetables_grown_in_garden)

split_data <- chckapmalawi |> 
  separate_rows(vegetables_grown_in_garden, sep = ",\\s*") |> 
  mutate(vegetables_grown_in_garden = trimws(vegetables_grown_in_garden)) |> 
  filter(vegetables_grown_in_garden != "")  

vegetable_freq <- table(split_data$vegetables_grown_in_garden)
vegetable_freq_df <- as.data.frame(vegetable_freq)
names(vegetable_freq_df) <- c("Vegetable", "Frequency")

vegetable_freq_df$Percentage <- vegetable_freq_df$Frequency / sum(vegetable_freq_df$Frequency) * 100

chart <- amPieChart(
  data = vegetable_freq_df,
  category = "Vegetable",
  value = "Frequency",
  depth = 30, 
  legend = FALSE, 
  chartTitle = "Vegetables Grown in Garden (Malawi)",
  animated = 1,
  theme = "spiritedaway"
) 
```
